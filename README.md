[INFO]
This is a simple converter that can convert m3u (or txt) files into a single mp3 file.
The purpose of the program is mainly to easily convert m3u playlists from audio streams
(for example streamcloud.com). All the user has to do is download the desired m3u file
(often intercepting network traffic from the streaming site) and enter it into the program.
The links contained in the m3u/txt file are downloaded as mp3 and (optionally)
chained together directly to get the full audio stream as one mp3.

> _m3u = a text-file that conatins a list of links. often used to manage online streaming.

[TROUBLESHOOTING]
- If you want to listen to the exported audio file, make sure that the m3uc program is closed.
- if the program bugs or something: just restart it
- when the program downloads the links of the m3u file, it does not care if there is a mp3 file behind the link! Check this before you start.
- if you use stream-playlists m3u's than hurry up! The links in the playlist are temporary.
- choose not to check the accessibility of the links
- check if the links in the m3u are downloadable
